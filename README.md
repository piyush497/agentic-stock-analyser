## Project Title

**AI-Powered Agentic Financial Insight Generator**

---

## Functionality Covered

This project is designed as a sophisticated, multi-step **agent** that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform complex analysis by selectively calling external **tools** (e.g., Python scripts or APIs) for up-to-date and specific financial data.

The core functionalities covered include:

* **Real-Time Data Acquisition:** The agent utilizes external financial APIs (like Alpha Vantage or Finnhub) to dynamically fetch current stock prices, volume, and key financial metrics based on the user's query.
* **Multi-Faceted Analysis:** It goes beyond simple data retrieval by employing the LLM for:
    * **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing recent news headlines and social media trends related to a target stock.
    * **Trend Identification:** Interpreting technical indicators (e.g., moving averages) derived from historical data.
* **Reasoning and Synthesis:** The **agentic flow** dictates that the LLM processes raw data, analytical outputs, and sentiment scores, synthesizing them into coherent, narrative summaries and actionable insights.
* **Recommendation Generation:** The final output is a structured report providing an overall outlook, identifying potential risks, and offering a clear, concise recommendation (e.g., Hold, Buy, or Sell) supported by grounded data.
